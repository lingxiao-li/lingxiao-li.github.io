abstract = {ML models are increasingly being pushed to mobile devices, for low-latency inference and offline operation. However, once the models are deployed, it is hard for ML operators to track their accuracy, which can degrade unpredictably (e.g., due to data drift). We design Nazar, the first end-to-end system for continuously monitoring and adapting models on mobile devices without requiring feedback from users. Our key observation is that often model degradation is due to a specific root cause, which may affect a large group of devices. Therefore, once Nazar detects a consistent degradation across a large number of devices, it employs a root cause analysis to determine the origin of the problem and applies a cause-specific adaptation. We evaluate Nazar on two computer vision datasets, and show it consistently boosts accuracy compared to existing approaches. On a dataset containing photos collected from driving cars, Nazar improves the accuracy on average by 15%.},

year	= {2024},
abstract = {This paper introduces Bifröst, a novel 3D-aware framework that is built upon diffusion models to perform instruction-based image composition. Previous methods concentrate on image compositing at the 2D level, which fall short in handling complex spatial relationships (e.g., occlusion). Bifröst addresses these issues by training MLLM as a 2.5D location predictor and integrating depth maps as an extra condition during the generation process to bridge the gap between 2D and 3D, which enhances spatial comprehension and supports sophisticated spatial interactions. Our method begins by fine-tuning MLLM with a custom counterfactual dataset to predict 2.5D object locations in complex backgrounds from language instructions. Then, the image-compositing model is uniquely designed to process multiple types of input features, enabling it to perform high-fidelity image compositions that consider occlusion, depth blur, and image harmonization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that Bifröst significantly outperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for generating realistically composed images in scenarios demanding intricate spatial understanding. This work not only pushes the boundaries of generative image compositing but also reduces reliance on expensive annotated datasets by effectively utilizing existing resources in innovative ways.},

abbr={arXiv},

year	= {2024},
abstract = {Radar-based contactless cardiac monitoring has become a popular research direction recently, but the fine-grained electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is still hard to reconstruct from millimeter-wave radar signal. The key obstacle is to decouple the cardiac activities in the electrical domain (i.e., ECG) from that in the mechanical domain (i.e., heartbeat), and most existing research only uses pure data-driven methods to map such domain transformation as a black box. Therefore, this work first proposes a signal model for domain transformation, and then a novel deep learning framework called radarODE is designed to fuse the temporal and morphological features extracted from radar signals and generate ECG. In addition, ordinary differential equations are embedded in radarODE as a decoder to provide morphological prior, helping the convergence of the model training and improving the robustness under body movements. After being validated on the dataset, the proposed radarODE achieves better performance compared with the benchmark in terms of missed detection rate, root mean square error, Pearson correlation coefficient with the improvement of 9%, 16% and 19%, respectively. The validation results imply that radarODE is capable of recovering ECG signals from radar signals with high fidelity and can be potentially implemented in real-life scenarios.},

author	= {Lingxiao Li and Yi Zhang and Shuhui Wang},
year	= {2023},
abstract = {Few-shot image generation is a challenging task since it aims to generate diverse new images for an unseen category with only a few images. Existing methods suffer from the trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated images. To tackle this problem, we propose Hyperbolic Attribute Editing(HAE), a simple yet effective method. Unlike prior arts that work in Euclidean space, HAE captures the hierarchy among images using data from seen categories in hyperbolic space. Given a well-trained HAE, images of unseen categories can be generated by moving the latent code of a given image toward any  meaningful directions in the Poincaré disk with a fixing radius. Most importantly, the hyperbolic space allows us to control the semantic diversity of the generated images by setting different radii in the disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HAE is capable of not only generating images with promising quality and diversity using limited data but achieving a highly controllable and interpretable editing process.},

  abstract={Data center network provides a basis for internet-based applications nowadays, thereby the reliability of it is vital. The purpose of this research is to examine and compare the reliability of two data center network architectures, which are Common Tree and Fat-tree topology structure. To verify the reliability of these two architectures, a tool called PRISM with the function of probabilistic model checking is used in this paper. Results show that Fat-tree topology structure is more reliable than Common Tree, and the reliabilities of core layer, edge/ aggregation layer and terminal layer decline sequentially.},
