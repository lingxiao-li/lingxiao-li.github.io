**Bio:** Lingxiao Li is an incoming PhD student in Computing and Data Science at Boston University, where he will be advised by [Prof. Boqing Gong](http://boqinggong.info/). He is currently a research assistant at [MMLab](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/index.html), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, working with [Prof. Xiangyu Yue](https://xyue.io/). 

He received his bachelor's degree with honours in Computer Science from the University of Liverpool, advised by [Prof. Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/), and earned his master's degree in Computer Science from Columbia University, where he worked with [Prof. Junfeng Yang](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/) and [Prof. Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/). He also collaborates closely with [Prof. Shuhui Wang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~wangshuhui?language=en) at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and [Prof. Chenyu You](https://chenyuyou.me/) at Stony Brook University.

Lingxiao's research interests lie in building machine learning systems with strong generalization under minimal supervision. His current focus spans **generative models**, **unsupervised (self-supervised) learning**, **multi-modal learning**, and **representation learning**. He serves as a reviewer for leading conferences and journals including CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and TPAMI.

Outside of research, he is an avid admirer of classical music, particularly the works of Chopin, Brahms, and Mahler.
